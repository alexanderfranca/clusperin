# clusperin
Tool to cluster proteins (Fasta format).

## Getting Started

**clusperin** is a crucial part of a major set of packages: 

* keggreader
* keggimporter
* blasperin
* clusteringloader

But to run **clusperin** you only need a set of Fasta files with protein sequences and proper script parameters.

Those Fasta files is expected to be generated by **anendb** web interface.

But you can generate those files manualy. They have to follow the rules below:

* Each file is a set of proteins from a single EC number.
* Example of a file name:

```
EC_2.3.4.5.fasta
```

**Notice** the file format: 'EC\_' **plus** your EC number **plus** '.fasta'

* **ALL** the parameters in the .clusperin.conf file are **mandatory**.

```
